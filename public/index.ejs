        <div class="flex-item faq-item">
          <span class="question">1. Is this compliant with the Condo Act?</span>
          <p class="answer">
            Yes! We have obtained legal opinion from a top
            Condominium Law Firm in Toronto. Our electronic proxies comply with
            Subsection 51 and 52 of the Condominium Act, 1998, as well as the
            upcoming Bill 106 changes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex-item faq-item">
          <span class="question">2. How is fraud prevented?</span>
          <p class="answer">
            Our system emails a confirmation link to owners after their proxy is
            submitted, the owner must click on this link. Submissions are also
            verified against the Corporation's owner
            registry. Additionally, forms can be protected with access codes
            unique to each unit owner.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex-item faq-item">
          <span class="question">3. How do we get the completed proxies?</span>
          <p class="answer">Proxies are emailed to your property manager the
            instant an owner completes it. We also send you all completed forms,
            in PDF format, on the day of the meeting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex-item faq-item">
          <span class="question">4. How long does it take to setup?</span>
          <p class="answer">
            Typically within a few business days, take a look at <a href="/how-it-works.html">How It Works</a> for more details.
