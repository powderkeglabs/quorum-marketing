        <span class="question">1. How do you prevent proxy fraud?</span>
        <p class="answer">
          After an owner completes the electronic proxy form, a message with a
          confirmation link is sent to the email address registered to the
          owner. The owner must click on the link in order to finalize the
          proxy form. This verification step ensures that the proxy is valid.

        <span class="question">2. Is this really legal?</span>
        <p class="answer">
          Yes! We have obtained legal opinions from a number of top
          Condominium Law Firms in Toronto. Our electronic proxies comply with
          Subsection 51 and 52 of the Condominium Act, 1998. In fact, these
          law firms have agreed that our electronic proxies do a better job of
          preventing fraud than traditional paper proxies.

        <span class="question">4. How do we get the completed proxies?</span>
        <p class="answer">Proxies are emailed to your property manager the instant they're
          completed by the owner. We can also send you a secure link to
          download all submitted proxies.</p>
