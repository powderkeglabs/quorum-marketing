        <p>Completing an electronic proxy is simple and takes only a few minutes, even for the those owners that aren't as "techie". All that's needed is a web browser and an internet connection, there's no app to download or install.</p>

        <p>Our smart email system will periodically remind owners to complete their proxy, but only if they haven't already done so. You don't want to canvas; owners don't want to be disturbed. Now everyone can enjoy their Netflix in peace. </p>
