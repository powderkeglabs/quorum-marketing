### Privacy

PowderKeg Labs Inc. (“**PKL**” or “**we**”, “**our**” or “**us**”) value our users, clients and customers, including you (“**you**”) and we respect your privacy.  We only collect personal information about you with your consent. This privacy policy (the “**Policy**”) describes the kinds of personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it, how we protect it, and under what circumstances we share it with third parties. This Policy also describes the decisions you can make about your personal information. You may require us to change, amend or delete the personal information that you have provided to us at any time. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Website.
If this Policy changes in the future, we will post an updated version on our website at www.getquorum.com (the “Website”). We recommend that you check this Website periodically in order to review our current Policy. You can tell if this Policy has changed by checking the effective date that appears at the bottom of this Policy.

### Information We Collect

When you access the Website and use the proxy tool, you voluntarily give us certain personal information including your name, your condominium unit number and your email address. In addition, when you visit our Website, we collect certain information about your activity on our Website, as described below under the heading “Our use of Cookies and Log Files”.

### Using Information We Collect

We use the personal information you have agreed to provide to us in order to: communicate with you for the purposes you have separately indicated when you signed up to the Website; learn more about you and your product preferences by looking at, among other things, the IP address of your computer and your activity on the Website; and address problems with, and improve, our website design and services.
We will not share, sell or rent your personal information in personally identifiable form with any third party, except if, and to the extent necessary, in our good faith judgment, doing so is required to: comply with laws or regulations; respond to a valid subpoena, order, or government request; establish or exercise PKL’s legal rights or defend against legal claims; investigate, detect, supress, prevent or take action regarding illegal or prohibited activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the reputation or physical safety of any person; or as otherwise required by law.
We may remove personal identifiers from your information and maintain and use it in aggregate form that may later be combined with other information to generate anonymous, aggregated statistical information. Such anonymous, group data may be shared on an aggregated basis with our business partners, but we will not disclose your personally identifiable information unless we receive your express consent to do so.
If PKL is to be sold, merged or amalgamated or substantially all of its assets are to be sold or disposed of, your personal information may be transferred to a potential purchaser if, and to the extent necessary, it is required for the purposes of deciding whether to proceed with the proposed transaction and completing it. If such a sale, merger, acquisition or disposal is completed, the purchaser may use and disclose your personal information only to the extent described in this Policy if the information relates solely to the carrying on of the business or activity or the carrying out of the objects for which the sale, merger or acquisition took place.

We will retain your personal information only for a time and to the extent necessary for the purposes for which it was collected as described in this Policy and for reasonable backup, archival, audit, or other similar purposes.

### Your Decisions About Your Personal Information

At any time you can contact us to: stop receiving e-mails from us; review the personal information held by PKL in connection with your submitted proxy; withdraw your consent for our use and disclosure of your information; request a list of third parties to which PKL may have provided your personal information; and amend your personal information, where possible, by clicking **Unsubscribe**.

If you contact us to do any of the things listed above, we may require you to provide sufficient personal information to allow us to identify you and tell you about the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information and this personal information will only be used for this purpose. If you contact us about your personal information, we will respond to your request within a reasonable time and at no cost to you.  

### Our Use of Cookies and Log Files

We use browser tracking cookies (or “**cookies**”), which are small text files that are placed on the hard disk of a computer by a website. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a website or web server that issued the cookie to you.  We also use browser “log files” which record certain information when you visit a website, including your internet protocol (IP) address. To improve your experience on our Website, we use cookies and logs files to: recognize you when you return to our website; keep track of activity on our Website and remember what items you have clicked on or viewed; study how you navigate through our website and which products you request in site searches so that we can improve the design, content and function of our Website; and customize the message, content and delivery of online banner advertisements and e-mails that reflect how you navigate to and through our Website based on your online behavior. We call this “Browsing Data”. We may hire third-party service providers to assist us in the collection and analysis of this Browsing Data collected through cookies, but none of your personal information is disclosed to these third party service providers.  

You have the ability to accept or decline our use of cookies. You can refuse cookies by turning them off or blocking them in your internet browser. If you decide to turn off or block cookies, our website might not function correctly.

### Security

We aim to provide you with a safe experience. We have in place certain physical, electronic, technological, and organizational safeguards to appropriately protect the security and privacy of your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying use or modification. Please note, however, that while we try to create a secure and reliable Website for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from the Website or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed.
We limit access to your personal information within PKL to individuals on a need-to-know basis.
Your personal information may be transferred, processed and retained on servers in countries outside of Canada, including the United States, and may therefore be subject to laws that do not offer the same degree of protection as Canadian law, although PKL will ensure that contractual protections, at least equal to its own standards, are put in place with those owning or managing servers located outside Canada. While we undertake to protect your personal information when it is transferred to other jurisdictions, the laws of other jurisdictions may require the disclosure of your personal information to governmental authorities under circumstances that are different than those that apply in Canada and are contemplated under this Policy.

### Links to Other Sites

We provide links on our Website to other, third party sites we think you will enjoy. These sites operate independently of us and have established their own privacy and security policies. Any personal information you provide on linked pages or other sites is provided directly to that third party and subject to that third party’s privacy policy. We strongly encourage you to review these policies at any site you visit. This Policy does not apply to such linked pages or other sites, and we are not responsible for the content or practices of any linked websites which are provided solely for your convenience.

### Children’s Online Privacy Protection

The Website is not intended for use by children under the age of 18. PKL does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from any children under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information from a child under the age of 18, we will make commercially reasonably efforts to delete such personal information from our database.

### Questions or Comments

If you have any questions or comments or wish to make a complaint about this Policy, please feel free to contact us by clicking [Contact Us](/contact).  If you contact us about your personal information, we will respond to your request within a reasonable time and at no cost to you.
